# finance_webinar_notes

These are my personal handwritten notes from the webinars I attend.
They reflect my understanding and interpretation of the content, not a word for word copy.
All original material, including slides and direct quotes, belongs to the speakers and organisers of such events.

I’m sharing these notes for educational purposes, and I encourage others to support the creators by attending their webinars or accessing their official materials.
If the organizers or speakers would like these notes modified or removed, I’m happy to comply: please contact me at 'jamesthompson2805@gmail.com'.
